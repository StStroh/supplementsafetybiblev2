SEED DATA IMPORT INSTRUCTIONS
===============================

The seed data is ready in scripts/sql-mapped/ directory.

OPTION 1: Import via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
------------------------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cyxfxjoadzxhxwxjqkez/sql
2. Execute each file in this order:

   Supplements (750 records):
   - scripts/sql-mapped/01_supplements_batch_2.sql
   - scripts/sql-mapped/01_supplements_batch_3.sql
   - scripts/sql-mapped/01_supplements_batch_4.sql

   Medications (150 records):
   - scripts/sql-mapped/02_medications_batch_1.sql

   Interactions (2500 records):
   - scripts/sql-mapped/03_interactions_batch_01.sql through 03_interactions_batch_11.sql

3. Verify counts:
   SELECT count(*) FROM supplements;  -- Should be 1000
   SELECT count(*) FROM medications;  -- Should be 150
   SELECT count(*) FROM interactions; -- Should be 2500

All files use ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING, so they're safe to re-run.
