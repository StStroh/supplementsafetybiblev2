## Evidence-Based Language Strategy

### Current Approach (Recommended)

The site successfully uses evidence-based language without implying institutional endorsements:

**Research References:**
- "Peer-reviewed sources"
- "Clinical documentation"
- "Scientific sources"
- "Evidence-based data"
- "Research-driven"

**Key Distinction:**

- ❌ Implies endorsement (avoided)

### Best Practices Being Followed

1. **Generic References:**
   - "Peer-reviewed academic research" ✅
   - "Scientific and clinical sources" ✅
   - NOT "Harvard-backed" or "Stanford-supported" ❌

2. **Methodological Descriptions:**
   - "Evidence-based" ✅
   - "Clinically documented" ✅
   - NOT "Certified by [institution]" ❌

3. **Independent Positioning:**
   - "Independent educational resource" ✅
   - "Developed with expertise" ✅
   - NOT "In partnership with [university]" ❌

---

## Disclaimer Review

### Current Disclaimers (Compliant)

**Medical Advice:**

- ✅ "Does not replace consultation with healthcare provider"
- ✅ "Designed to support doctor–patient decisions (not replace them)"

**Endorsements:**
- ✅ "Does not claim FDA endorsement or approval"
- ✅ "Not a medical endorsement or certification"

**Analysis:** Strong disclaimers prevent misinterpretation of authority or endorsement.
